   <h1>Benefits of walking your Dog on the beach</h1>

<h3>Adequate Space</h3>
<p> The beach affords adequate space for a dog to walk and even have a swim without disturbing or intimidating other beach users.
    A well trained dog on a leash can get the exercise they need while under the control and supervision of their owner. A regular walk is 
    vitally important for your pet's health too. Obesity in pets is associated with a number of medical complaints including osteoarthritis, 
    cardiovascular disease, liver disease and insulin resistance. Most dogs need to be walked at least once each day, though some dogs, 
    particularly very active dogs, may require more. A walk on the beach can make a dog very happy. They love to check out the sights and smells 
    and will really look forward to spending time with you. A dog that doesn't receive sufficient exercise can easily become bored or 
    destructive.

<h3>Cooling Down</h3>
<p>Most dogs enjoy the water and taking your dog for a bit of a swim is both fun for the dog and tires them out. A tired dog is a happy dog.
